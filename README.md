# politicaltldr
A place for witty TL;DR on popular people in the news.

### To set up locally

To set the site up locally, you need Jekyll and Ruby installed on your site. Head over to https://jekyllrb.com to get detailed instructions on how to set up everything. 

All the data is stored currently in `_data/politicians.yml`. To add a new person, copy an existing one and change the values. Remember, its yaml, so spacing matters. 

Do your work on a seperate branch and ping me (@matthewtrask) in the PR and Ill review and merge. Not that I don't trust you, randomy internet person; but I want to make sure
there isn't an error in the yaml that will take the site down.

### Code of Conduct

We have one, read it. 

Test deploy.
